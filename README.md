# CoordinateExpander
NLP-Tool to expand coordinate structures

## About
The Coordinate Expander can be used to expand coordinates on morpheme level in german sentences. It was developed within
the project [Qualifikationsentwicklungsforschung](https://github.com/spinfo/quenfo) in order to expand coordinates in 
job advertisements. A documentation (in german) about the developement and theoretical background is [here](http://dh.uni-koeln.de/sites/dighum/projects/bibb/5429692_Binnewitt_SM1_Hausarbeit.pdf).

## How to use it
This repo contains an eclipse project that can be used in as source in another eclipse project. Just to see how it
can be implemented you can look at the [demo application](../src/main/resources/de/uni_koeln/spinfo/demo/App.java).
